Binomial Operating Characteristic Curves
========================================================
This web application calculates and plots operating characterstic curves for up to four tests. 

Input Parameters
----------------
Input parameters for the app include:  

1. Number of shots for each test  
2. Number of failures for each test

<<<<<<< HEAD
By default all four tests are plotted. The user can modify the number of tests plotted by unselecting checkbox

next to the test entry values. 

Modifying Plot Attributes
-------------------------

To modify plot attributes just check the checkbox next to the "Modify Plot Attributes" on the left side panel.   
This allows the user to customize the plot such as changing the plot title, axes titles, test names, text sizes, thickness of lines, and other functionalities. 

Downloads
---------

The user can download the full dataset generated and plotted by the app by clicking on the "Download Data Sample" botton 
on the lower left side of the page.

The Binomial Distribution
-------------------------

The binomial distribution describes the outcome of an experiment where the outocme can take one of two possible values. 
The two possible values for the outcome are things like pass/fail, hit/miss, success/fail, and so forth.  

For an experiment with `n` independent trials where the probability of success is `p`, the probability of having `x` successful outocome in the experiment is given by the probability mass function:  


$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) & = {n \choose x} \, p^x \, (1-p)^{n-x} \,\, \mbox{   for  } x=0, 1, 2, ..., n\\
\mbox{ where }{n \choose x} & = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!} \mbox{ is the binomial coefficient}
\end{aligned}
$$

The binomial coefficient represents the number of different ways one can have `x` successes in `n` trials.  

This app calculates the probability of success given a number of shots and a number of failures as a function of the proportion defective.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\ 
\int x \, dx& = \frac{x^2}{2} + C
\end{aligned}
